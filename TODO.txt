-- Handle Button presses :: Priority - Highest --

Each menu (switch-case structure) will have a button handler function 
that will process which buttons have been pressed since the last cycle
  - the cycles are very fast, should only get one button press per cycle
  - in the regular menu, pressing up or down will increase or decrease current submenu item by 1
    - pressing the back button will go to the parent menu (divide by 10)
    - pressing enter will go into the submenu (multiply by 10)
  - when editing (eg: hours selection, amount selection, etc), override normal up/down behavior.

-- Temperature related safety drainage :: Priority - Medium-High -- 

  When the temperature in the lines (one of our thermistors will be measuring this) drops below a set temperatures (somewhere in the neighborhood of 33-35)
  We will periodically drain a small amount from the lines. The hope is that the movement of the relatively warm heatsink of water in the tank will be 
  considerably warmer than the water in the lines, so draining the water that is currently in the lines and replacing it with water from the tank 
  may well be sufficient to prevent freezing in the lines. If necessary, seeing as the thermistor is in the line, this could potentially drain the entire
  tank, if all of the water in the tank were below the threshold temperature. 
  
  we haven't cooked up the details on the particular thermistor yet, will update later.

-- Add One Time Task (tentative):: Priority - Low --

user has selected 'add task'
submenus made available:
  - hour (1-12)
  - minute (00,15,30,45)
  - am/pm
  - time or quantity
  - if time
    - hour
    - minute (15 minute intervals)
    - am/pm
  - elseif quantity
    - gallons
  - one time or repeat
  - month to run in
  - day to run on
  - cancel
  - complete (perhaps only shown after the others have been entered??)
  
--end--

-- Add Repeated Task (probable):: Priority - Medium --
user has selected 'add task'
submenus made available:
  - hour
  - minute
  - am/pm
  - time or quantity
  - if time
    - hour
    - minute (15 minute intervals)
  - elseif quantity
    - gallons
  - monday-sunday (boolean)
  - cancel
  - complete (perhaps only shown after the others have been entered??)
  

--water now option : Priority - High --

user has selected menu item for "water now"
submenus available:
  - quantity or time
    -if quantity
       -gallons
    -else time
      -hours
      -minutes (15 minute intervals)

-- end --

--watering behavior--

if presently watering
  - line 1 -- display time remaining or amount (gals) remaining
  - line 2 -- push back to end
  
-- end --

-- property changing note --
  for the add task menus, each property should be "dirty" before the "complete" option should become visible
  recommend keeping track of this with boolean variables, and checking on each entry.

-- Implement Task Manager :: Priority - High --

  Implement a task manager that can preferably execute an arbitrary number of tasks, at arbitrary times, as defined by a text file
  -- suggest a cron-like utility?
